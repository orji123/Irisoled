# IrisOLED
Arduino library for robotic OLED eye expressions for SSD1306 / SH1106 and other Adafruit-GFX-compatible displays

IrisOLED provides a collection of monochrome bitmaps (robotic eye expressions and useful icons) plus a small non-blocking animation helper so you can make expressive robot eyes without blocking the rest of your code.
